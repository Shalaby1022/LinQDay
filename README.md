# LinQDay- ITI Summer Training 
In this C# project, explored various LINQ queries to manipulate data in lists and arrays. The tasks involved filtering, sorting, and projecting data based on specific conditions.

Task 1 involved working with a list of numbers, where we displayed the distinct numbers in ascending order and calculated their multiplications.

Task 2 focused on an array of names, where we selected names with a length of 3 and sorted names containing the letter 'a' in ascending order of length.

Task 3 dealt with a list of students, allowing us to display each student's full name and the number of subjects they were enrolled in. Additionally, we sorted the list based on the students' first names in descending order and their last names in ascending order, displaying only the first and last names after ordering.

These tasks demonstrated the flexibility and power of LINQ, showcasing how concise and expressive queries can be used to efficiently manipulate data collections in C#.
